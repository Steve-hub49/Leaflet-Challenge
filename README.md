## Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

### Please note this project is deployed at: https://steve-hub49.github.io/leaflet-challenge/index.html

### Background

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

### Before I Started My Project

I created a new repository for this project called leaflet-challenge and cloned it to my computer.


Inside my local git repository, I created a directory for the Leaflet Challenge. 
 
 
This homework utilizes both html and Javascript. All necessary files have been added. These are the main files to run for analysis.


The above changes have been pushed to GitHub.



### My Task

Level 1: Basic Visualization

The first task is to visualize an earthquake data set.


The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. I visited the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and chose a data set to visualize. Choosing 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days' I received a JSON representation of that data. I utilized the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for my visualization.



Import & Visualize the Data
I created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from my data set based on their longitude and latitude.


Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by size while the depth of each earthquake is indicated by color. In short, earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.


Popups have been created to provide additional information about the earthquake when its marker is clicked.


A magnitude legend was created to provide context for my map data.


Level 2: More Data (Optional)

I did not do the optional portion of this assignment.
